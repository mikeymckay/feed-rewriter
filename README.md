This is a AWS lambda function that rewrites the RSS feed Pluralistic to a format that is easier for me to consume. To run it you will need to npm install the dependencies. You will need an AWS account with a lambda function named pluralisticbitesized and you will need the aws console tools installed and configured with your API key. I would like to turn this into a generic tool that filters RSS feeds - maybe someday. Fork freely, I'll pull plenty!
